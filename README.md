 Why GitHub and GitHub Actions?

### GitHub
Using GitHub allows me to:
- Keep my project version-controlled
- Collaborate and share my code easily
- Back up and restore my work when needed

### GitHub Actions
I use GitHub Actions to:
- Ensure my code builds successfully on other machines
- Catch errors early through automated testing workflows
- Simulate real-world deployment environments

This helps guarantee that the app works reliably across different setups and not just on my own computer.


I chose adark red and yellow theme because:
- These colors convey a serious and academic tone
- Dark red evokes history, tradition, and formality
- Yellow complements red by drawing attention to key areas (like correct/incorrect feedback)
